        <p class="text-justify"> With this delectable dish, we bring to you the tantalizing flavours of Garhwal. High in
          protein value,
          Chainsoo is prepared from Sabut Urad dal (black gram lentil) and is a popular lunch option for Pahadis
          living in any part of the world. To prepare this dish, you need to roast the lentils first and make a fine
          paste out of it. Transfer the mixture into an iron pot, keep the flame low and stir until it’s ready to serve.

            <p class="text-justify"> This appetizing dish may take a little more time to cook than others, but once it
              is
              ready all the time and effort will be worth it. Phaanu also spelled as ‘Phanu’ is prepared by mixing
              different
              lentils that are soaked overnight. This soupy dish, when served with freshly cooked white rice, makes a
              perfect luncheon for winter season.

            <p class="text-justify">Here is an all time favourite for the people of Uttarakhand and you ask why,
              because it is simple to make and scrumptious to savour. The entire preparation takes less than 15 minutes,
              so it is one of those dishes that one can abide by when either too tired or lazy to cook. Just boil some
              potatoes, prepare a simple onion and tomato curry and leave the potatoes in it to cook over slow fire and
              the result is well… surprising!
